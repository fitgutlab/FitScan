**FitScan** is an R Shiny application that turns a raw **Google Health / Fitbit Takeout export** into a clean, explorable cardiovascular dashboard — no terminal required. It wraps Python-based extraction (via `reticulate`) and `ggplot2`-based visualization behind a single browser interface: upload a `.zip`, extract, and visualise, all in one place.

FitScan is designed to be:

- **Upload-driven** – accepts the standard Google Takeout `.zip` export directly, no manual unzipping or file wrangling.
- **Multi-participant** – load as many participants as you like into one session and unlock cross-participant comparison plots.
- **Exploration-ready** – a fixed cardiovascular dashboard for the essentials, plus an interactive explorer for any variable, chart type, and date range.
- **Fully downloadable** – every plot (and every extracted summary) can be downloaded individually or bundled as a zip.

## Installation

### Requirements

- R (≥ 4.1) with the following packages: `shiny`, `reticulate`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `scales`, `patchwork`, `DT`, `zip`
- Python 3 (FitScan provisions its own virtual environment automatically on first launch — no manual Python setup needed)

### From GitHub

```r
# install.packages("remotes")  # if needed
remotes::install_github("barah123/FitScan")
```

Or clone directly and run it as a project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/barah123/FitScan.git
cd FitScan
```

```r
# From R, with the FitScan folder as the working directory
shiny::runApp(".")
```

The first launch takes a few extra seconds while `reticulate` builds a dedicated Python virtual environment (`r-fitbit-shiny`) with `pandas` installed. Every launch after that is instant.

## Input data format

FitScan expects the **Google Health Takeout `.zip`** exactly as downloaded from [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/) for a Fitbit-linked Google Health account, unmodified. Internally it looks for the standard Takeout layout:

```
Takeout/Google Health/Physical Activity_GoogleData/
    daily_resting_heart_rate.csv
    daily_heart_rate_variability.csv
    steps_*.csv
    activity_level_*.csv
    active_zone_minutes_*.csv
    sedentary_period_*.csv
    heart_rate_*.csv
    daily_respiratory_rate.csv
Takeout/Google Health/Sleep Score/
    sleep_score.csv
```

Each `.csv` inside the zip is read and merged into one **daily summary per participant** — you do not need to extract or rename anything yourself; just upload the `.zip` as-is.

## App features

### 1. Upload & Manage
Upload a Takeout `.zip`, assign a participant ID (auto-suggested, editable), and extract its daily Fitbit summary in one click. Repeat for as many participants as needed — they all stay loaded for the session. Each participant's summary is downloadable as CSV, individually or bundled as a zip.

### 2. Participant Dashboard
A fixed, publication-style dashboard for one participant at a time: resting heart rate trend, heart rate range per day, daily steps, activity composition, active zone minutes, HRV across sleep nights, sedentary bouts, sleep quality, and a composite overview panel. Every plot has its own PNG download, plus a "download all" zip.

### 3. Explore
An interactive builder: pick any participant(s), any numeric variable (steps, HRV, sleep score, respiratory rate, and more), a chart type (line / bar / point), and a date range. Renders on the fly and downloads as PNG.

### 4. Compare Participants
Unlocks once 2+ participants are loaded: resting HR trend across participants, daily steps faceted by participant, resting HR distribution boxplot, and an HRV comparison plot — each downloadable individually or as a bundle.

## Example workflow

1. Open the app and go to **Upload & Manage**.
2. Upload `takeout-XXXXXXXXTXXXXXXZ-3-001.zip`, set the participant ID (e.g. `P01`), and click **Extract & add to session**.
3. Repeat step 2 for additional participants (e.g. `P02`, `P03`, …).
4. Go to **Participant Dashboard** to view the full cardiovascular dashboard for a chosen participant.
5. Go to **Explore** to build a custom view — pick a variable, chart type, and date range across one or more participants.
6. Once 2+ participants are loaded, go to **Compare Participants** for cross-participant plots.
7. Download any plot with its **Download PNG** button, or grab everything at once with a **Download all (zip)** button.
